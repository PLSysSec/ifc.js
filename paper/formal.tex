\subsection{Security guarantees}
\label{sec:retrofit:formal}

In this section we present the formal security guarantees provided by
our embedding.
%
Concretely, we show that an IFC langauge, |specLang alpha (targetLang
nop)|, satisfies non-interference(NI)~\tocite{}.
%
Intuitively, non-interference states that secret values cannot be
leaked by programs written in the language.
%
As we show below, the precise scheduling policy |alpha| dictates
whether or not the guarantee holds for programs with diverging tasks.

We prove non-interference for |specLang alpha (targetLang nop)| using
the \emph{term erasure} technique of~\tocite{}.
%
Intuitively the term erasure technique allows us to show that a an
attacker does not learn any sensitive information from a program
written in a NI language, if the program behaves identically to the
same program with all sensitive data ``erased.''
% 
To accommodate for this, we extend our formalism to account for
programs with erased configurations and a function |erasef l| that
performs erasures, usually by rewriting (parts of) configurations that
are more sensitive than |l| to a new syntactic construct |bullet|.
%
Directly, we can now give a precise definition for the kinds of
languages we wish to prove NI.

\begin{definition}[Information-flow control language]
    An information-flow control language |L| is a tuple |(C, .->,
    erasef l)|, where $c \in |C|$ is the type of machine configurations, |.->| is a
    reduction relation between machine configurations and |erasef l : C -> tyerase C|
    is an erasure function parametrized on labels from machine configurations to \emph{erased} machine
    configurations |tyerase C|.  For sequential languages, the
    language is augmented with a set of terminal configuration states $V
    \subseteq |C|$ for which there are no possible further transitions.
\end{definition}

%{
%format .->  = "\overset{\alpha}{\hookrightarrow}"
Using this definition, |specLang alpha (targetLang nop) = (ifc C, ifc
V, .->, erasef il)|, such that $|ifc C| = |iS| \times \prod |it|$ and
$|ifc V| = |iS| \times |it|^*$, where $|it|^* \subset |it|$ it the
type for tasks whose expressions have been reduced to
values.\footnote{
  Here, we abuse notation by describing types for configuration parts using the
  same metavariables as the ``instance'' of the type, e.g., |it| for the type of
  task.
}
%
The erased configuration |tyerase (ifc C)| extends |ifc C| with configurations
containing |bullet|; Figure~\ref{fig:erasure} gives the precise definition for
our erasure function.
%
A task and its corresponding message queue is completely removed from the task
list if its label does not flow to the attacker observation level |il|;
otherwsie, apply the erasure function homomorphically and remove any message
from the task's message queue that are more sensitive than |il|.\footnote{
We note that the definition of |erasef il| precisely captures the IFC
language's attacker model.  For instance, in our case, by removing sensitive
tasks and messages from the system, we assume that that the attacker cannot
observe the number of sensitive tasks or messages.

\begin{definition}[$l$-equivalence]
    In a language |(C, .->, erasef l)|, two machine configurations
    |memberf (c, c') C| are considered $l$-equivalent (|c ~= c'|)
    if |erase l c = erase l c'|.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Termination Sensitive Non-Interference (TSNI)]
  A language |(C, .->, erasef l)| is termination
  sensitive non-interfering if for any label |l|, and configurations
  |c1, c1', c2 member C|, if
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:tsni-lhs}
    |c1| \approx_{|l|} |c2|
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    |c1| |.->|^* |c1'|
  \end{equation}
  then there exists a configuration |c2' member C| such that
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:tsni-rhs}
    |c1'| \approx_{|l|} |c2'|
     \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    |c2| |.->|^* |c2'|
    \ \text{.}
  \end{equation}

\begin{theorem}[Concurrent specification language is TSNI]
For any target language |targetLang nop|, |specLang roundrobinf
(targetLang nop)| satisfies TSNI.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Termination Insensitive Non-Interference (TINI)]
  A language |(C, V, .->, erasef l)| is termination
  insensitive non-interfering if for any label |l|, and configurations
  |c1, c2 member C| and |c1', c2' member V| if
   $|c1| \approx_{|l|} |c2|$,
   $|c1| |.->|^* |c1'|$, and
   $|c2| |.->|^* |c2'|$, then
   $|c1'| \approx_{|l|} |c2'|$.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}[Sequential specification language is TINI]
For any target language |targetLang nop|, |specLang seqf (targetLang
nop)| satisfies TINI.
