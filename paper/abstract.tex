\begin{abstract}
Many important security problems in JavaScript, such as browser extension
security, untrusted JavaScript libraries and
safe integration of mutually distrustful websites (mash-ups), 
may be effectively addressed using an efficient implementation
of course-grained information flow control.
Using JavaScript as a motivating and illustrative example, 
we formally specify a coarse-grained IFC system that
can be implemented non-intrusively in a variety of language contexts, 
resulting in
much greater implementation efficiency than previous finer-grained approaches.
The main advance involves identifying isolation mechanisms
that allow IFC to track interaction between program
components whose internal operation is not tracked
because the entire component has the same label.
By presenting other language examples, we suggest that this 
is a general method for adding IFC to existing
languages,
provided an appropriate isolation mechanism can be identified.
We also describe how to relate optimized concrete implementations
to the IFC systems produced by our technique.
