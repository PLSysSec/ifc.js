HIGH LEVEL
----------
- High overlap with previous LIO work [1]
- Scheduler result and compositional proof should be emphasized more [1]
- Real language applications (esp)/extensions non-technical/preliminary/vague;
  generality of method is not convincing [1,2,3]
- How are external effects handled (e.g. XMLHttpRequest)? [1,2]
[FIXED] Drop monadic presentation [1]

LOW LEVEL
---------
- Confusion about how mutable references are handled (Sec 6),
  integration not necessary [1]
- Renamed theorems in Section 7: theorem 3-4 are just two parts of
  theorem 5. Also, rename to lemma. [1]

Page 10, Proof of Theorem 3. Why induct on the length of the derivation
sequence instead of inducting on the structure of the derivation
directly?

In section 2.4, the paper asserts "It would be a violation of
information flow if [a mutable reference could be shared with another
task]". I don't believe this is true. If the labels are equal, then the
reference can be shared without restriction. If there are two labels, l
and H, such that L < H, then the task labeled L can only write to the
reference and the task labeled H can only read from the reference. This
effectively produces a one-way channel.

In section 5.3 JavaScript, why are only strings allowed to be sent across a
channel? Shouldn't an arbitrary JSON value be safe?

Also in section 5.3, there's not much development of SWAPI, and I cannot
find any further references on the main author's website nor via Google.
This contributed to me not feeling comfortable with the JavaScript
implementation.

In Figure 5, should the second line have a call to \varepsilon_l?
