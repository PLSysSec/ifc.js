\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we develop a general coarse-grained approach to IFC
based on dividing a system into relatively course computational units
and tracking only communication between these isolated units.
We give formal semantics for the core coarse-grained
information flow control language and show how a large class of target languages
can be combined with it to achieve provable
non-interference.
We then give a proof technique for showing  non-interference
of a concrete semantics for a potentially optimized IFC language
by means of an isomorphism, and identify a class of IFC language restrictions
that preserves non-interference.
We briefly describe ways to enrich the core IFC language with
more advanced concepts such as labeled values, privileges, or a
notation of clearance and
connect our formal semantics to real implementations of
coarse-grained IFC systems for Javascript, Haskell, and
(in less detail) enforcing IFC in C.
Leaving more detailed presentation to later work,
we informally relate our results to a monadic interpretation
of IFC which guided our design.
